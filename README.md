# Simple Neural Network for Iris Classification

This repository contains a simple neural network model implemented in PyTorch for classifying the Iris dataset.

## Overview

The notebook walks through the process of building, training, and evaluating a basic feedforward neural network to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is used here. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a categorical target variable (the species).
